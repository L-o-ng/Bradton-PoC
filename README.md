# Bradton-PoCClient

Erica Bellamy, Director of Digital Health and Social Care (Faculty of Health Studies) 

Project Brief 

Erica has seen Birley Place (mmu.ac.uk) and would like to create a version for the University of Bradford (UoB) but containing our own content. Research Birley place including videos such as https://youtu.be/vXvEVwZgvX4 and produce proof of concepts (PoC) and reports for how we can create our own version. 

Personas 

Students on health and social care courses will access the site to view content and complete study activities. Students will access from a range of devices including mobile phones. 

Lecturer – need to access results from activities, may use phone but more likely to use UoB provided laptop. 

Course lead – will administer the system to add new content, laptop user. 

Assumptions 

Up to 20% of students can be expected to have dyslexia or other learning disability. The PoC needs to incorporate accessibility requirements and identify any potential shortfalls of the platform. 

Academic staff are generally not very IT savvy so the method to add or alter content needs to be relatively straightforward. 

Students are unlikely to want to install an app, so a browser based solution is needed. 

Out of Scope 

A pedagogical approach has not yet been decided and is out of scope for the PoC work. 

Content 

Example case studies and activities created by Erica is available in the Bradton PoC SharePoint group created for the project. 

For the PoC images etc can be taken from anywhere that copyright won’t be an issue e.g. Adobe Stock. 

Functional Requirements 

It is envisioned that students will access Bradton through a map or street view style interface. E.g. students selects a house to view case study and activities (see Briley Place videos). 

It must support different content types such as written, images and videos. 

It must support teaching activities such as quizzes. 

Academics need to be able to add new content e.g. add a new house to the street 

Non-Functional Requirements 

Work on a range of devices (i.e. mobile, laptop and desktop) and browsers (Chrome & Edge). 

Solution needs to be sustainable i.e. low recurring cost and easily maintainable 

Access to content needs to be performant and support users on slower internet connections. 

Possible Platforms for a Proof of Concept 

Office365 - SharePoint Spaces, MS Forms, Stream, etc

Unity (Web) 

Deliverables 

Evaluate the platforms (and any others you may identify through research) against the requirements. 

Produce proof of concepts for the possible platforms. Focus on the platforms mostly likely to meet the requirements first, do as many / refine as much as possible within the time – aim to create at least one PoC with a report by the end of the week. 

Create a short report to accompany each PoC outlining the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen technology stack in relation to the project requirements.
